    <h1> A Small Wonder</h1>
    
    <div class="textnimg">
    <p>Atop the hill, amidst the hard boulders where the Sun shone down in all its might,
     a tiny crevice between the giant rocks eked out a little yellow flower.</p>

    <main><p>For decades gusts of wind blew across these barren  dark rocks, making them even drier, 
        slowly eroding and taking away with it, whatever carried even a remote promise of new life.</p>

        <p>The seasons had a way of changing but even amidst that, all that was constant around here was bleakness.
        Nothing grew, nothing changed. The rare green that looked like a painter's mistake was the timid grass 
        which always lay low. Under the burden of the enormous rocks, it never felt it rightfully belonged to this land 
        of the Sun and the Wind. Its green was more a dry brown as it lived through each day of anicipation,
        dreading the day when the Sun would throw down fire and the whimsical Wind would just go crazy wild,
        tearing down its existence.</p>
    <div class="textnpic">
        <p> But as the Sun and the Wind revelled and roared in their own glory and might,it never occurred to them that 
        somewhere, deep down where the underground river flowed in the subterranean veins, a seed lay. Fed by the stream,
        it had a dormant purpose: it carried a vision of life. It looked up to the light, it had a dream to fulfil as it 
        sprouted tiny shoots that on reaching surface, became branches.</p>

        <p>Throbbing life inside made every daily struggle almost a thrill to take on Sun and Wind.Many of its leaves got scorched and torn but new ones pushed out and grew
        back. It took very long to bloom into this bright yellow flower,but once it did, Sun and Wind knew it was to stay...</p>

        <h2>  A miracle is never a miracle: its rarity of occurence makes it seem like one.</h2>
    </main>       
    <article><p> Many years have passed since then, and now it looks like a different canvas: plants and bushes have come up,
      even the earlier subservient grass is learning to raise its head and growing out significantly greener and 
      longer blades, even if in the shadow of the bigger bushes. The flowers, even if ocassional,look like they belong here.
      Now the sun smiles down and the wind blows it tune as the plants with intermittent splashes of bright colors of
      spring and fall, sway and grow on the once-barren land.</p>
